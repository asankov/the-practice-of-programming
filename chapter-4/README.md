# Chapter 4: Interfaces

## Chapter summary

Building a program is one thing, writing a code that is going to be consumed from others, another.
In this chapter we will take a look at designing libraries and the problems that are to be solved in that aspect:

- Interfaces - defining meaningful interface that expose enough functionallity, but in the same time hide the internals well
- Information hiding - what is public and what private?
- Resource management - who is responsible for the resources shared with the library?
- Error handling - how do you handle errors, how do you recover from one and how do you return them to your consumer?
