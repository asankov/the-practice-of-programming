# Chapter 4: Interfaces

## Section 4.1 Comma-Separated Values

**Summary:** Comma-separated values (CSV) is a well-known text format for representing tabular data.
In this chapter we will build a library to read CSV data and convert it into an internal represenation.

The chapter includes a tcl script that downloads data from `quote.yahoo.com`, but the link is outdated,
and instead of looking for a new one, I would just hardcode some data in a file.

Sample data csv file: [data.csv](data.csv)
