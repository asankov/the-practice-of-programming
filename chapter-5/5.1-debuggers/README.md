## Chapter 5: Debugging

### Section 5.1 Debuggers
**Summary:** One powerful tool for debugging are debuggers. Most language come with one.
However, debuggers are system and setup dependent. Sometime, it may be more useful to put a print statement somewhere
or think hard about why the code could be broken. Blind probing with a debuger is not likely to be productive.
Also, if you bug logs in the code, they stay in the code, but debugging sessions are transient, and when they are over,
all of the information that was collected is lost.
