# Chapter 5: Debugging

### Section 5.4 Last Resorts
**Summary:** When all of the things in the last two chapters don't work it's time for the last resorts.

Bugs could be as simple as misconseption in operator precendence, to a typo or a wrong parameter order.

It's not a good option to blame the compiler or the CPU at first, but sometimes it is indeed their fault.

Another nasty problem causes are the memory leaks. They cannot be reproduced every time, and make your program fail in mysterious ways.
