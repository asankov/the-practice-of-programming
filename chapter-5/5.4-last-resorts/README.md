# Chapter 5: Debugging

## Section 5.4 Last Resorts

**Summary:** When all of the things in the last two chapters don't work it's time for the last resorts.

Bugs could be as simple as misconseption in operator precendence, to a typo or a wrong parameter order.

Another nasty problem causes are the memory leaks. They cannot be reproduced every time, and make your program fail in mysterious ways.
