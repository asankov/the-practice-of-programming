# Chapter 5: Debugging

## Section 5.8 Summary

Whether we like debugging or not, we will have to do it regullarly. That is why it's important to write good code with fewer bugs.

Once we see a bug, the first thing to do is think how it could have happened and where it could have come from.
The next steps are to put a few debugging statements and find where exactly the bug is - **divide and conquer**.

Other aids are explaining our code to someone else (rubber duck debugging), using debugging tools and stepping through our program.

Finally, know yourself and the errors you make. When you have found and fixed the bug, think of a similar places where the same bug may exist.
