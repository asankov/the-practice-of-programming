# Chapter 6: Testing

## Section 6.7 Who Does the Testing?

Testing should be done by the implementer.

However, the implementer is aware of the code as has assumptions which could lead to missing valid test cases (white-box testing).

Black-box testing (not knowing the code) is also a good approach, because it approaches the testing process without any assumptions.

User testing is also important, because the user is the one that uses the software.
