# Chapter 3: Design and Implementation

## Chapter summary

Defining the data structures is a big part of desing a program. Once that is laid out, and if laid out well,
the code will start fitting itself and the algorithms will be fairly obvious.

In this chapter we will implement the [Markov Chain Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) in a variaty of languages, to assess the differences and
similarities between each of them.
