# Chapter 3: Design and Implementation

## Section 3.5 Java

**Summary:** Let's rewrite these stuff in [Java](Markov.java)!

### Exercise 3-4

Revise the Java version of `markov` to use an array instead of a `Vector` for the prefix in the `State` class.

_Answer:_ An array makes more sense than `Vector`, because the size is fixed and known when the object is instantiated.
Therefore, we don't need data struct that can grow and shrink dinamically.

**BONUS:** Refactor the Java code to use up-to-data structures and practices:

- Generics - `Map<Prefix, Vector<String>>` instead of `Hashtable`
- Remove use of deprecated constructor of `StreamTokenizer`
- Static constructor, instead of constructors with fields that differ from the fields of the class
